# ðŸŽ® Number Guessing Game

A simple Python game where the user guesses a number within a specified range.

## How It Works

- The program randomly selects a number within a chosen range (e.g., 1â€“100).
- The user guesses the number:
  - If the guess is **smaller** than the target number, the program will prompt:
    "Choose a higher number."
  - If the guess is **greater** than the target number, the program will prompt:
    "Choose a smaller number."
- The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number.
